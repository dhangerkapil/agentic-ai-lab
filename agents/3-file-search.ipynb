    "We'll optionally remove the vector store, the uploaded files, and the agent. In a production environment, you might keep them around longer. Meanwhile, here are some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management**\n",
    "   - Keep files grouped by category, regularly prune old or irrelevant files.\n",
    "   - Clear out test agents or vector stores once you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search Queries**\n",
    "   - Provide precise or multi-part queries.\n",
    "   - Consider synonyms or alternative keywords (\"gluten-free\" vs \"celiac\").\n",
    "   \n",

    "   - Always disclaim that you are not a medical professional.\n",
    "   - Encourage users to see doctors for specific diagnoses.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ **Important Fixes Applied**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Import Issues Fixed**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ This didn't work:\n",
    "from azure.ai.projects.models import FileSearchTool, FilePurpose\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ This approach works:\n",
    "# Create tools directly as dictionaries: {\"type\": \"file_search\"}\n",
    "# Use string values like \"assistants\" instead of FilePurpose enum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Vector Store Creation Fixed**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Original broken approach:\n",
    "project_client.agents.upload_file_and_poll()\n",
    "project_client.agents.create_vector_store_and_poll()\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Working API structure:\n",
    "project_client.agents.files.upload_and_poll()\n",
    "project_client.agents.vector_stores.create_and_poll()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. File Search Access Fixed**\n",
    "The key breakthrough was using **message-level file attachments** instead of agent-level tool_resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ This caused SDK compatibility issues:\n",
    "agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(\n",
    "    tools=[{\"type\": \"file_search\"}],\n",
    "    tool_resources={\"file_search\": {\"vector_store_ids\": [vs_id]}}\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ This works reliably:\n",
    "# 1. Create simple agent with file_search tool\n",
    "agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(\n",
    "    tools=[{\"type\": \"file_search\"}]\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Attach files at message level\n",
    "message = project_client.agents.messages.create(\n",
    "    thread_id=thread_id,\n",
    "    role=\"user\",\n",
    "    content=question,\n",
    "    attachments=[{\n",
    "        \"file_id\": file_id,\n",
    "        \"tools\": [{\"type\": \"file_search\"}]\n",
    "    }]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. API Method Updates**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Old patterns:\n",
    "project_client.agents.create_thread()\n",
    "project_client.agents.create_message()\n",
    "project_client.agents.create_and_process_run()\n",
    "project_client.agents.list_messages()\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct API structure:\n",
    "project_client.agents.threads.create()\n",
    "project_client.agents.messages.create()\n",
    "project_client.agents.runs.create_and_process()\n",
    "project_client.agents.messages.list()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Key Concepts Learned**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Search Tool**: Enables agents to search through uploaded documents using semantic search\n",
    "- **Vector Stores**: Convert documents into searchable numerical vectors\n",
    "- **Message-Level Attachments**: More reliable than agent-level tool_resources for current SDK version\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Agents can find relevant content even when exact words don't match\n",
    "- **Responsible AI**: Always include medical disclaimers for health-related content\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **API Methods Mastered**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `project_client.agents.files.upload_and_poll()` - File upload with polling\n",
    "- `project_client.agents.vector_stores.create_and_poll()` - Vector store creation\n",
    "- `project_client.agents.create_agent()` - Agent creation with file search capabilities\n",
    "- `project_client.agents.threads.create()` - Conversation thread creation\n",
    "- `project_client.agents.messages.create()` - Creating messages with file attachments\n",

    "\n",
    "## 💡 **Best Practices Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Attachment Strategy** - Use message-level file attachments instead of agent-level tool_resources\n",
    "2. **API Structure** - Use the nested client structure (agents.files, agents.threads, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Vector Store Management** - Keep documents organized and clean up when done\n",
    "4. **Health Content** - Always include medical disclaimers for health-related responses\n",
    "5. **Resource Cleanup** - Delete agents, vector stores, and files to manage costs\n",
    "6. **Error Handling** - Implement fallback approaches for SDK compatibility issues\n",
    "7. **Semantic Search** - Leverage vector stores for intelligent document search\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If file search isn't working:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Use message-level file attachments instead of agent-level tool_resources\n",
    "2. ✅ Verify files were uploaded successfully (check file IDs)\n",
    "3. ✅ Use correct API structure (agents.files.upload_and_poll)\n",
    "4. ✅ Attach individual files to messages, not just vector stores\n",
    "\n",
    "**If import errors occur:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Use dictionary-based tool definitions: `{\"type\": \"file_search\"}`\n",
    "2. ✅ Use string literals instead of imported enums: `\"assistants\"`\n",
    "3. ✅ Import only what's actually available in the SDK version\n",
