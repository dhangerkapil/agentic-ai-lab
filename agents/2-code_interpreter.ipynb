    "# Congratulations! üéâ\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully completed the **Health Calculator Agent** with **Code Interpreter** tutorial! Here's what you accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ **What We Built**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ü§ñ Health Calculator Agent**\n",
    "- Created an AI agent with **Code Interpreter** capabilities\n",
    "- Enabled the agent to write and execute Python code in a secure sandbox\n",
    "- Configured health-focused instructions with appropriate disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "### **üìä Key Features Demonstrated**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üìÅ File Upload & Management**\n",
    "   - Uploaded CSV nutrition data to the Azure AI service\n",
    "   - Learned correct file upload methods and purposes\n",
    "   - **Fixed CSV file access issues** by using message-level file attachments\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **üßÆ BMI Calculations**\n",
    "   - Agent performed step-by-step BMI calculations using Python code\n",
    "   - Converted between imperial and metric units\n",
    "   - Interpreted results with health categories\n",
    "   - Provided responsible AI disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìà Nutrition Data Analysis**\n",
    "   - Agent loaded and analyzed CSV data programmatically\n",
    "   - Computed statistical averages for macronutrients\n",
    "   - Generated data visualizations and trend analysis\n",
    "   - Provided insights with appropriate health disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **üîß Resource Management**\n",
    "   - Properly cleaned up agents, files, and local resources\n",
    "   - Demonstrated best practices for resource lifecycle management\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è **Important Fix: CSV File Access Issue**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Problem**\n",
    "Initially, the agent couldn't access the uploaded CSV file, resulting in the error: *\"It seems there was an issue locating the file.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Root Cause**\n",
    "The issue was with how files were attached to the agent. Using `tool_resources` in the agent creation was causing SDK compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Solution**\n",
    "Instead of attaching files at the agent level, we attach them at the **message level**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ‚ùå This caused issues:\n",
    "# tool_resources={\"code_interpreter\": {\"file_ids\": [uploaded_file.id]}}\n",
    "\n",
    "# ‚úÖ This works:\n",
    "message = project_client.agents.messages.create(\n",
    "    thread_id=thread.id,\n",
    "    role=\"user\", \n",
    "    content=user_text,\n",
    "    attachments=[{\n",
    "        \"file_id\": uploaded_file.id,\n",
    "        \"tools\": [{\"type\": \"code_interpreter\"}]\n",
    "    }]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Lessons**\n",
    "- **Message-level attachments** are more reliable than agent-level tool_resources\n",
    "- Always test file access in agents before proceeding with analysis\n",
    "- The Azure AI SDK is evolving - message-level attachments are the current best practice\n",
    "\n",

    "## üí° **Best Practices Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Attachment Strategy** - Use message-level file attachments instead of agent-level tool_resources for better compatibility\n",
    "2. **Data Handling** - Validate inputs, handle missing values, manage file attachments properly\n",
    "3. **Health Disclaimers** - Always remind users you're not a medical professional\n",
    "4. **Resource Management** - Clean up agents and files to avoid unnecessary costs\n",
    "5. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error handling for file operations and API calls\n",
    "6. **Testing** - Always test file access before proceeding with analysis\n",
    "7. **Security** - Use code interpreter for trusted operations only\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç **Troubleshooting Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If agents can't access uploaded files:**\n",
    "1. ‚úÖ Use message-level attachments instead of agent-level tool_resources  \n",
    "2. ‚úÖ Verify the file was uploaded successfully (check file ID)\n",
    "3. ‚úÖ Ensure the correct file purpose (\"assistants\") is used\n",
    "4. ‚úÖ Include file attachments in individual messages, not globally\n",
