    "4. **Provide the following details:**\n",
    "   - **Connection Name**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., \"my-ai-search\")\n",
    "   - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription\n",
    "   - **Resource Group**: Choose your resource group\n",
    "   - **Azure AI Search Resource**: Select your existing search service or create a new one\n",
    "5. **Click \"Add Connection\"** to complete the setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Alternative: Use Azure CLI**\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "## ‚úÖ **What We Accomplished**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Azure AI Search with Vector Search & Semantic Configuration**\n",
    "   - Created a search index with **vector embeddings** for semantic search\n",
    "   - Configured **HNSW algorithm** for efficient vector similarity search\n",
    "   - Used **Azure OpenAI embeddings** (text-embedding-ada-002) to vectorize product descriptions\n",
    "   - Implemented **integrated vectorization** with AzureOpenAIVectorizer\n",
    "   - Added **Semantic Configuration** (required for SEMANTIC query type)\n",
    "   - Included price information in embeddings for better context understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ü§ñ AI Agent with Semantic Search Capabilities**  \n",
    "   - Created an agent using **SEMANTIC query type** (powered by vector embeddings)\n",
    "   - Agent understands semantic meaning and can find products based on:\n",
    "     - **Categories** (\"strength training\", \"cardio\", \"flexibility\")\n",
    "     - **Use cases** (\"muscle recovery\", \"home gym\", \"conditioning\")\n",
    "     - **Concepts** (\"affordable\", \"budget-friendly\", \"full-body\")\n",
    "     - **Natural language** queries without exact keyword matches\n",
    "   - Seamless integration with real-time semantic search results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üí° Key Improvements Over Simple Search**\n",
    "   - **Semantic Understanding**: Finds relevant items based on meaning, not just keywords\n",
    "   - **Context Awareness**: Understands \"muscle recovery\" ‚Üí foam roller, yoga mat\n",
    "   - **Better Relevance**: Returns results based on semantic similarity\n",
    "   - **Richer Embeddings**: Combined name, category, description, and price in vector embeddings\n",
    "   - **Natural Language**: Understands intent from conversational queries\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **üìä Technical Implementation**\n",
    "   - **Vector Field**: `DescriptionVector` with 1536 dimensions\n",
    "   - **Vector Search**: HNSW algorithm for fast approximate nearest neighbor search\n",
    "   - **Semantic Config**: Required for SEMANTIC query type with Name, Description, Category fields\n",
    "   - **Manual Vectorization**: Pre-computed embeddings using Azure OpenAI\n",
    "   - **Official SDK**: Uses `azure-search-documents` and `azure-ai-agents` packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ **How Vector Search Works in This Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing Time**:\n",
    "   - Documents are enriched with text combining all relevant fields + price\n",
    "   - Azure OpenAI generates 1536-dimensional embeddings\n",
    "   - Embeddings stored in `DescriptionVector` field\n",
    "   - HNSW algorithm creates efficient search structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Time**:\n",
    "   - User asks a natural language question to the agent\n",
    "   - Agent uses SEMANTIC search (leverages pre-computed vectors)\n",
    "   - Search returns most semantically similar items\n",
    "   - Agent formats results with prices and details\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß **Technical Architecture**\n",

    "\n",
    "## üìñ **Key Learnings**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Search Types**:\n",
    "   - **VECTOR query type**: Requires runtime vectorization (authentication challenges)\n",
    "   - **SEMANTIC query type**: Uses pre-computed vectors (what we implemented)\n",
    "   - Both leverage the same vector index and embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Required for SEMANTIC query type\n",
    "   - Defines title, content, and keyword fields\n",
    "   - Improves relevance ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedding Strategy**:\n",
    "   - Include all relevant context in text for embedding\n",
    "   - Price information embedded as text: \"Price: $59.99\"\n",
    "   - Enables semantic understanding of price concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best Query Patterns for Semantic Search**:\n",
    "   - ‚úÖ **Good**: \"affordable strength training equipment\" (concepts)\n",
    "   - ‚úÖ **Good**: \"equipment for muscle recovery\" (use cases)\n",
    "   - ‚úÖ **Good**: \"budget-friendly home gym options\" (categories)\n",
    "   - ‚ùå **Limited**: \"show items under $50\" (exact numerical filters)\n",
    "   - ‚ùå **Limited**: \"what's the cheapest item\" (superlatives requiring sorting)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **When to Use What**:\n",
    "   - **Semantic Search**: Best for understanding intent, categories, concepts\n",
    "   - **Filters**: Best for exact numerical ranges (combine with OData: `Price le 100`)\n",
    "   - **Hybrid**: Combine semantic search + filters for best results\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ **Next Steps & Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add OData Filters**: Combine semantic search with exact price filters\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   filter=\"Price le 100\"  # Combine with semantic search\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hybrid Search**: Combine keyword search + vector search\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   search_text=\"strength\",  # Keyword search\n",
    "   vector_queries=[vector_query]  # Vector search\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Semantic Ranker**: Enable L2 semantic ranking for better relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-field Vectors**: Create separate vectors for different aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Query Expansion**: Let agent rephrase queries for better results\n",
