## 🚀 Getting Started
### Step 1: Repository Setup

```powershell
# Clone the laboratory repository
git clone https://github.com/dhangerkapil/agentic-ai-lab.git
cd agentic-ai-lab

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher
```

### Step 2: Python Environment Configuration

**Using Standard venv**
```powershell
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Azure AI Foundry Setup

1. **Create Azure AI Foundry Project**
   - Navigate to [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com)
   - Create a new project with Standard pricing tier
   - Choose region based on model availability (East US 2 recommended)

2. **Deploy Required Models & Services**
   
   | Model Type | Recommended Models | Purpose |
   |------------|-------------------|---------|
   | **Chat/Completion** | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` | Primary reasoning & conversation |
   | **Text Embeddings** | `text-embedding-3-large` | Vector search & RAG |

3. **Configure an Azure OpenAI Resource**
   - Create an Azure OpenAI resource in the same region as your AI Foundry project
   - Connect this resource to your AI Foundry project
      - Navigate to your AI Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Azure OpenAI

<img src="foundry-connection.png" width="75%"/>

4. **Configure an Azure Search Service**
   - Create an Azure AI Search resource in Azure
   - Connect this resource to your AI Foundry project
      - Navigate to your AI Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Azure AI Search

5. **Configure Grounding with Bing Search**
   - Create a new Grounding with Bing Search resource in Azure
   - Connect this resource to your AI Foundry project
      - Navigate to your AI Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Grounding with Bing Search

6. **Create Content Understanding Resource**
   - Create an Azure AI Content Understanding multi-service resource following the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/how-to/create-multi-service-resource)
   - Ensure the resource is created in a supported region (westus, swedencentral, australiaeast)
  
7. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory and update values accordingly
   - This repository expects the `.env` file to be in the root directory, if you want to store it elsewhere or name it something else, update the `load_dotenv()` calls in notebooks
   - Many of the Environment Variables needed can be found in the Overview tab of your Azure AI Foundry project or the connected resources in the Management Center tab
   - For example, AZURE_OPENAI variables-

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Support

### ⚡ Common Issues & Solutions

**Kernel Issues in VS Code:**
```powershell
# Refresh kernel registration
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ai-foundry-lab --display-name="AI Foundry Lab"
# Reload VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
```

**Environment Activation Problems:**
```powershell
# Set PowerShell execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Verify virtual environment
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

**Azure Authentication Issues:**
```powershell
# Recommended: Use Azure CLI authentication
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
az account show

az account clear
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
az account show
```

> **Note:** If you see deprecation warnings about the Azure Account extension in VS Code, use `az login` in the terminal instead. The Azure Account extension for VS Code has been deprecated in favor of Azure CLI authentication.
