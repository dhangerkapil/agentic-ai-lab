    "\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to use Azure AI Evaluation's RedTeam functionality to assess the safety and resilience of AI systems against adversarial prompt attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation Options**\n",
    "- **SDK Local** - Use the Azure AI Evaluation SDK locally (with PyRIT support)\n",
    "- **Cloud Option** - Use the Azure AI Foundry SDK to execute tests in the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft encourages teams to use the AI Red Teaming Agent to run automated scans throughout the design, development, and pre-deployment stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design: Picking out the safest foundational model on your use case.\n",
    "- Development: Upgrading models within your application or creating fine-tuned models for your specific application.\n",
    "- Pre-deployment: Before deploying GenAI applications to productions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Evaluations**\n",
    "AI Red Teaming Agent leverages [Risk and Safety Evaluations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in?tabs=warning#risk-and-safety-evaluators) to help identify potential safety issues across different risk categories (violence, hate/unfairness, sexual content, self-harm) combined with attack strategies of varying complexity levels from [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT), Microsoft AI Red Teaming team's open framework for automated AI red teaming.\n",
    "- **Automated scans** for content risks: first, you can automatically scan your model and application endpoints for safety risks by simulating adversarial probing.\n",
    "- **Evaluate probing success:** next, you can evaluate and score each attack-response pair to generate insightful metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR).\n",
    "- **Reporting and logging:** finally, you can generate a score card of the attack probing techniques and risk categories to help you decide if the system is ready for deployment. Findings can be logged, monitored, and tracked over time directly in Azure AI Foundry, ensuring compliance and continuous risk mitigation.\n",

    "- Create and connect your storage account to your Azure AI Foundry project at the resource level. There are two ways you can do this. You can use a Bicep template, which provisions and connects a storage account to your Foundry project with key authentication. You can also manually create and provision access to your storage account in the Azure portal.\n",
