    "# Multi-Agent Ticket Triage System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **multi-agent system** using Azure AI Agent Service for automated ticket triage. The system uses multiple specialized agents that work together to analyze support tickets and determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Priority Level** (High/Medium/Low)\n",
    "- **Team Assignment** (Frontend/Backend/Infrastructure/Marketing)\n",
    "- **Effort Estimation** (Small/Medium/Large)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of:\n",
    "1. **Three Specialist Agents**: Each focused on one aspect of ticket analysis\n",
    "2. **One Orchestrator Agent**: Uses the specialist agents as tools to provide comprehensive triage\n",
    "3. **Connected Agent Tools**: Enable the orchestrator to call specialist agents as needed"
